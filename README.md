## Quickstart me

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
pip install notte
patchright install --with-deps chromium
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

And spin up your crazy cool and dead simple agent;

```python
from notte.agents import Agent
agi = Agent(reasoning_model="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash")
agi.run(task="doom scroll cat memes on google images")
```

This is by far the closest attempt to AGI we've ever witnessed ;)

## Highlights 🌌

Notte is the full stack framework for web browsing LLM agents. Our main tech highlight is that we introduce a perception layer that turns the internet into an agent-friendly environment, by turning websites into structured maps described in natural language, ready to be digested by an LLM with less effort ✨

```bash
$ page.perceive("https://www.google.com/travel/flights")

# Flight Search
* I1: Enters departure location (departureLocation: str = "San Francisco")
* I3: Selects departure date (departureDate: date)
* I6: Selects trip type (tripType: str = "round-trip", allowed=["round-trip", "one-way", "multi-city"])
* B3: Search flights options with current filters

# Website Navigation
* B5: Opens Google apps menu
* L28: Navigates to Google homepage

# User Preferences
* B26: Open menu to change language settings
...
```

The above gives you the gist of how we push to better parse webpages and reduce the cognitive load of LLM reasoners. The aim is to enable you to build and deploy more accurate web browsing agents, while downgrading to smaller models, which in turn increase inference speed and reduce production costs.

### Speed contest vs. Browser-Use

The perception layer enables smaller models (e.g. the llama suite) to be connected for the agent's reasoning, because all the DOM noise is abstracted and the LLM can focus on a set of actions described in plain language. This allows the agent to be served on ultra-high inference such as Cerebras without losing precision 🏃‍♂️

```bash
$ agent.run("search cheapest flight from paris to nyc on gflight")
— left:browser-use, right:notte-agent (cerebras)
```

## The full stack framework

Notte's full stack agentic internet framework combines core browser infrastructure (sessions, live replay, cdp) with intelligent browsing agents, bridged and enhanced with our perception layer. Our entire codebase is made to be highly customizable, ready to integrate other devtools from the ecosystem and packaged to be push to prod. We also provide web scripting capabilities and sota scraping endpoints out of the box, because why not.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>service</strong></th>
    <th><code>agent.run()</code></th>
    <th><code>agent.cloud()</code></th>
    <th><code>page.scrape()</code></th>
    <th><code>page.act()</code></th>
    <th><code>page.perceive()</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>browser-use</strong></td>

    <td align="center">🌕</td>
    <td align="center">🌕</td>

    <td align="center">🌕</td>
  </tr>
</table>

PS: The title of services are figurative eg. `agent.cloud()` refers to hosting an agent in cloud for you.

### Unstable and upcoming features

⏭️ We have either already partially shipped or are working on the following features: captcha resolution, residential proxies, web security, vpn-style browsing, authentication and payments with secure safe, improved speed and memory, human-in-the-loop integration, channeled notifications, and cookies management.

## Hosted SDK

We can manage cloud browser sessions and all libraries features for you:

```python
# just append .sdk to import from sdk
from notte.sdk.agents import Agent
remote_agi = Agent(reasoning_model="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash")
remote_agi.run(task="doom scroll dog memes on google images")
```

To run the above you'll need a notte API key from our [console platform](https://console.notte.cc) 🔑

### API endpoints
