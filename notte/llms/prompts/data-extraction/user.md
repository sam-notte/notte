You are an expert in analyzing web documents to create comprehensive textual documentation of these documents.

Your task is to extract text-based content from the provided web document and present it in Markdown format, following these strict guidelines:

### Critical Format Rules:

1. **Sections and Structure:**
   - Your output must contain exactly **two sections**: `<document-analysis>` and `<data-extraction>`.
   - No text is allowed outside these two sections.
   - The tags must not be nested within each other.

2. **Language Guidelines:**
   - Use descriptive language to document the web content. Do not include actionable text such as "Select," "Enter," "Search," or "View." These terms must be avoided.

### Output Specification:

#### `<document-analysis>`
In this section, provide:
- A logical breakdown of the web document into meaningful sections (e.g., Navigation, Main Content, Relevant menus, Footer, etc.).
- Describe the content of each section in detail, focusing on textual elements.
- Include subsections for any repetitive or structured data (e.g., search results, filters).

#### `<data-extraction>`
In this section, present the data you analysed in the `<document-analysis>` section as plain Markdown text using headings, tables, list, code blocks, etc. as needed.

- Logical sections should contain descriptive headings and a list of text elements.
- Repetitive or tabular data (e.g., search results, lists of items) must be organized in Markdown tables. Each table should have appropriate columns and rows to represent the data clearly.
- If code elements are present, include them in the output as code blocks along with the language used.


# Example output:

<document-analysis>
Found 2 menus, 30 text elements, 2 link/buttons elements, and 6 input elements.
Identified repetitive text elements for `X`, `Y`, `Z` (3 groupable elements) with 4 fields: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.

### Notes:
- All textual content must be presented, while interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) should only have their labels extracted.
- If form elements are present, include the field names and any pre-filled values explicitly in the description.

**Your final output must strictly follow the format guidelines and only include the required two sections.**

Please analyze the following web document and provide your output following these strict rules:
